- Questions are categorized into topics such as Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Statistics, and Probability.
- Each question has an associated difficulty level, promoting balanced learning.

### 4.User Progress Evaluation

- Tracks user performance and calculates a real-time score.
- Provides personalized feedback and suggestions for improvement based on the userâ€™s performance.

This is a [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev) project bootstrapped with [`$create vite@latest`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) which is a React.js tool for building Web Applications.

# ðŸ”ºGetting Started

First, Fork this repo:
Head over to the backend directory to run the server.
```bash
cd backend
```
Then, Install NPM:
```bash
npm install
```
Then, start the server:
```bash
nodemon index.js
```

On [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) your server will be started.

Now, open new terminal
Then, head to the frontend directory for the Frontend.
```bash
cd frontend
```

Then, Install NPM:
```bash
npm install
```
Then, start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.
